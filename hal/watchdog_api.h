/** \file watchdog_api.h
 *
 * This module provides platform independent access to the system watchdog timer
 * which is an embedded peripheral that will reset the system in the case of
 * system failures or malfunctions.
 *
 * The watchdog timer initialises a system timer with a time period specified in
 * the configuration. This timer counts down and triggers a system reset when it
 * wraps. To prevent the system reset the timer must be continually
 * kicked/refreshed by calling hal_watchdog_kick which will reset the countdown
 * to the user specified reset value.
 *
 * The watchdog timer supports a second mode of operation called windowed mode.
 * When configured in this mode by setting enable_window to true, the watchdog
 * will enable a restriction on the kick. If the watchdog timer is kicked too
 * soon after it has last been refreshed a system reset occurs. The earliest
 * time in milliseconds the timer can be kicked without triggering a reset is
 * specified by window_ms.
